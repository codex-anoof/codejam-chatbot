1.3.  Effects of  the Industri...","While the Industrial Revolution didn't originate in Sri Lanka, its effects were felt significantly because Sri Lanka was a British colony at the time.  The British established large-scale plantations (tea, coconut, rubber), importing machinery from Britain to process these crops.  This led to the creation of factories and a need for a labor class to work in them.  A wealthy, educated middle class also emerged, comprised of landowners and factory owners.  The capitalist economic system grew in Sri Lanka as a result.  Infrastructure improvements, such as the introduction of the Macadam method for road building and the expansion of the railway system (starting with the Colombo to Kandy line in 1867), also occurred.  A formal postal system was established, starting with the use of chariots to connect major cities, and the first postal stamp was issued in 1857.  The telegram service began in 1858.  The development of roads and transportation led to the growth of new trade centers and cities.","{'sections': ['N/A'], 'pages': 'Page 27, Page 28, Page 9'}"

This system had the governor responsible to the British crown, but the East India Company remained in charge of collecting revenue.  The system failed because the East India Company officers did not adequately support Governor North, leading to its discontinuation in 1802.  The coastal regions then became a direct colony of the British crown.","{'sections': ['N/A'], 'pages': 'Page 36, Page 61, Page 75'}"
